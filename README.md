Vote predictor (temp name)
==============
THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.

Saying our current political climate is in turmoil is a gross understatement. We are deliberately bombarded with data so that we lose sight of what is important. This is why it is important to use statistical analysis to act as a guiding light in our search for the relevant.
__Vote predictor__ is a statistical model based on the [model](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/GerrishBlei2012.pdf) by Gerrish and Blei. The model attempts to predict how lawmakers vote. Lawmakers follow certain patterns when voting. These patterns exist because lawmakers should to the best of their ability follow what their constituents want. The purpose of this tool is to raise a flag indicating that a lawmaker is voting differently than expected. This change in behavior might happen for many different reasons, the author of this tool hopes the user to look more into what might have caused their deviation.
